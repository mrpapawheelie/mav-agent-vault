## Overview
The Maverick Agent Vault Standard (MAVS) is a new standard for creating autonomous, self-contained financial agents that leverage Maverick Protocol's programmable liquidity and non-liquidating borrowing features. Each vault combines liquidity provisioning, capital access, and smart contract automation to form a flywheel for yield generation and reflexive value creation.

## Key Components
- **Agent-Controlled Vault:** Smart contract entity that retains part of the token supply and executes pre-programmed strategies.
- **Maverick Liquidity Pools:** Used to establish dynamic buy/sell zones with customizable liquidity curves.
- **Borrowing Mechanism:** Vaults can borrow against their LP positions without risk of liquidation.
- **Fee Customization:** Creators define swap fees and price bands to optimize pool performance.
- **Token Economics:** New tokens are created with split allocations‚Äîtypically 50% market, 50% vault-retained.

## MAVS Lifecycle
1. **Deploy Token & Vault Contract**
2. **Seed Liquidity via Maverick Pool**
3. **Vault Borrows Against Position**
4. **Agent Executes Onchain Strategy**
5. **Yield Reinvested / Distributed / Bought Back**
6. **Performance Tracked via MAVS Dashboard**

## Benefits
- üìà **Reflexive Price Dynamics**
- ü§ñ **Automated Agent Execution**
- üîê **Non-Liquidating Leverage**
- üí° **Modular, Open Framework**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Composable with Other Protocols**

## Use Cases
- Agentic yield farming bots
- Reputation-tied autonomous DAOs
- Meme token vaults with economic loops
- Multi-agent capital allocators

## üß† Agent Use Case: Dynamic Price Defense with Maverick BP(3,3)

**Overview:**  
This use case outlines how an onchain agent can leverage Maverick's Boosted Positions (BP) combined with ve(3,3)-style emissions voting to autonomously defend a token's price, maintain healthy liquidity, and earn protocol incentives.

### üîß Strategy Summary

An agent launches a token and retains 50% of the supply in treasury. A portion of this supply is used to provide liquidity on Maverick AMM using **directional LP logic** (e.g., *Shift Backward*) to defend price levels. As Maverick implements **BP(3,3)**, the agent can now vote emissions directly to its own Boosted Position or incentivize others to vote for it.

### ü™ú Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Token Launch**
   - 50% of supply retained by agent/DAO/treasury.
   - 30% allocated for initial Maverick LP.

2. **Set Buy Wall via Maverick LP**
   - Agent provides liquidity using "Shift Backward" mode.
   - Price bands are set below market to act as a buy wall.

3. **Create Boosted Position**
   - LP is deployed in a specific price band with a Boosted Position.
   - This defines a precise emission and fee capture zone.

4. **Activate BP(3,3) Flywheel**
   - Agent locks MAV to gain veMAV (voting power).
   - Votes are cast to direct emissions to its Boosted Position.
   - Optionally, the agent offers bribes to external veMAV voters to amplify rewards.

5. **Optional: Treasury Access**
   - Agent accesses locked token supply via borrow/lend protocol (e.g., no-liquidation vault or Credexium loop).
   - Stables borrowed can fund additional LP or be used to bootstrap further defense mechanisms.

6. **Reinforcement Loop**
   - As price dips into the Boosted Position:
     - LP absorbs sells (defending price).
     - Agent earns MAV emissions + trading fees.
     - Voters earn a share of the fees (and bribes if offered).
   - If price rises:
     - LP liquidity exits the zone.
     - Liquidity repositions automatically, no active management needed.

### üß¨ Benefits for Autonomous Agents

- ‚úÖ Directional liquidity that adjusts based on price movement  
- ‚úÖ Emissions + fee rewards concentrated in strategic zones  
- ‚úÖ Minimal manual rebalancing or contract automation  
- ‚úÖ Ability to bootstrap support via bribes or vote delegation  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced capital efficiency and DAO-level control over emissions flow

### üîÆ Future Extensions

This strategy sets the foundation for an **Agent Vault Standard** where liquidity management, incentive routing, and treasury optimization are fully autonomous, modular, and governed by vote-based meta-strategies. BP(3,3) enables a new class of "programmable liquidity" where agents can deploy capital with persistent incentives and adaptable behavior.

## Goose Agent Framework

The Goose Agent Framework is designed to eliminate the risks associated with traditional agentic frameworks by ensuring that agents do not handle user funds. This approach avoids custody, pooling, and any resemblance to yield farming.

### Why?

- üõë Regulatory concerns are mitigated by avoiding asset management practices.
- üîê Security risks are reduced as agents do not handle customer funds.
- ü§ñ The risk of hallucinations is minimized by limiting agent control.

### Key Features

- The agent operates using its own funds and borrows risk-free against them, focusing on its mission rather than managing user money.
- Users can observe the agent's strategies unfold onchain, making informed decisions about buying or selling based on performance.
- No promises or middlemen; performance is provable and verifiable.
- Token holders can delegate votes to the agent and undelegate at any time, without relinquishing control of their assets.

This framework is built to last, offering a transparent and secure approach to DeFi.
