# Maverick Agent Vault Standard (MAVS)

> **Autonomous Capital Powered by Maverick Protocol**

## Overview
The Maverick Agent Vault Standard (MAVS) is a new standard for creating autonomous, self-contained financial agents that leverage Maverick Protocol's programmable liquidity and non-liquidating borrowing features. Each vault combines liquidity provisioning, capital access, and smart contract automation to form a flywheel for yield generation and reflexive value creation.

## Key Components
- **Agent-Controlled Vault:** Smart contract entity that retains part of the token supply and executes pre-programmed strategies.
- **Maverick Liquidity Pools:** Used to establish dynamic buy/sell zones with customizable liquidity curves.
- **Borrowing Mechanism:** Vaults can borrow against their LP positions without risk of liquidation.
- **Fee Customization:** Creators define swap fees and price bands to optimize pool performance.
- **Token Economics:** New tokens are created with split allocations‚Äîtypically 50% market, 50% vault-retained.

## MAVS Lifecycle
1. **Deploy Token & Vault Contract**
2. **Seed Liquidity via Maverick Pool**
3. **Vault Borrows Against Position**
4. **Agent Executes Onchain Strategy**
5. **Yield Reinvested / Distributed / Bought Back**
6. **Performance Tracked via MAVS Dashboard**

## Benefits
- üìà **Reflexive Price Dynamics**
- ü§ñ **Automated Agent Execution**
- üîê **Non-Liquidating Leverage**
- üí° **Modular, Open Framework**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Composable with Other Protocols**
